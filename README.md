# Binary representation

## This program was made to interpret a number as a sum of powers of two.
## Inspired by the Theorem presented on the introduction to mathematical proofs MAT102.
## Theorem: Every natural number n >= 1 can be represented as a sum of distinct non-negative integer powers of 2.
